# Course 1 - custom loss functions, Functional API etc. 

It's useful to know how to use the functional API som one can make complex NN architectures and broaden their scope beyond simple sequential models

good example is the [inception model](https://perspectumdiagnostics.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/Research%20and%20Technical%20Development/Image%20Analysis/Digital%20Pathology/validation_data?csf=1&web=1&e=M7gPOW) explained in the linked blogpost. 

example of multi-input models are the [Siamese networks](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/chopra-05.pdf) for face recognition. here's a nice [presentation](http://slazebni.cs.illinois.edu/spring17/lec09_similarity.pdf) about similarity learning. 

[Paper](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/hadsell-chopra-lecun-06.pdf) on Dimensionality reduction by learning and invariant mapping. I actually read this and understood it! That's quite rare. Used in Siamese networks. Describes the contrastive loss function.
